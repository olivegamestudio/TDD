## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The `Pilgrimage` quest system.** A standalone quest library with no project references:
  `QuestDefinition` and `QuestTrigger` for authored content, `Quest` for the
  `NotStarted → Active → Completed` lifecycle, `QuestLog` for the player's quests and their
  persistence, and `ICampaign` as the seam a game supplies quests through. The model declares
  what fires a quest; measuring it belongs to the presentation. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1), [#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **Quest 1, "Get out. The debris field is collapsing around you."** Auto-starts on a new game,
  and completes when the player reaches the exit marker 1000 units forward. Both triggers are
  proximity triggers, sized so a ship travelling at speed still fires them. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1))
- **`OliveGameStudio.World`** — `Position` and `Player`, the X/Y spatial model. The player exposes
  `MoveTo`/`MoveBy` only, leaving control input and physics a separate concern that drives it. ([#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **`IWorld` and `QuestProximityWatcher`** in the game — where each quest's markers stand, and the
  per-frame measurement that drives the quest API from the player's position. ([#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **Saved games.** `SaveGame` and `SaveGameSerializer` persist the player's position and every
  quest's state. Quest states are written by name — and read by name only — so neither reordering
  the enum nor a number in the file can silently change a saved state, and a missing or damaged
  save reads back as "no save" so a corrupt file yields a new game rather than a crash.
  `GameSession` saves when a quest starts or completes rather than every
  frame. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1))
- **`IGameSession.SaveError` and `IGameSession.IsSavingProgress`** report whether the player's
  progress is being kept and what went wrong when it is not, so the state is readable rather than
  guessed at. Nothing displays them yet — that needs a HUD. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1), [#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **`OliveGameStudio.Localisation`** — `ITextProvider` and a JSON-backed `JsonTextProvider` owning
  the culture fallback chain, caching and the missing-key policy. A language is a file named after
  its culture; fallback is applied per key, and a key present in no language throws
  `MissingTextException` rather than showing the player a key. ([#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **Quest 1's title in seven languages** — English (source), French, Italian, German, Spanish,
  Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese, shipped as `Text/<culture>.json` beside the game. Adding a
  language is a file drop: no rebuild, no satellite assembly. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1))
- **Project documentation** — this changelog, a README, and the design canon, architecture notes
  and workflow under `docs/`.

### Changed

- **`ISaveProgressService` gained `Load` and `Save`**, both in terms of text, so the engine stays
  agnostic about what a save contains and the same service works for any game built on it. ([#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **`BattleForceCampaign.Quests` is built on each read** rather than in a field initialiser. The
  campaign is a DI singleton, so a cached list froze the player's language at startup. It is read
  only when a game starts or resumes, so it is not on the frame path. ([#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))

### Fixed

- **A save the game could not read no longer freezes it, and is no longer overwritten.**
  `Continue` documented a fallback to a new game when the save "cannot be read" but only recovered
  from damaged *content*; the read itself was unguarded, so an `IOException` from a file locked by
  cloud sync came straight out into a task nothing holds — the session never became ready, every
  frame turned straight back, and the game had quietly stopped with no crash and no log. Damaged
  and unreadable are now distinguished: a damaged save is replaced, because its content is already
  gone, while an unreadable save is played over **without being written to**, because it may be
  perfectly intact. A save that cannot be *written* no longer stops the game either, and leaves
  saving on so the next quest tries again. Only `IOException` and `UnauthorizedAccessException`
  count as storage getting in the way — anything else is a defect and is still
  thrown. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1), [#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **A quest state that is not a state no longer bricks the quest.** `JsonStringEnumConverter` reads
  numbers as well as names and does not check that the number names a defined member, so
  `"State": 99` deserialised to `(QuestState)99` — a quest that could never start and never
  complete, dead for the rest of the game. Refused at both layers: the serializer reads states by
  name only (`allowIntegerValues: false`), so a numeric state is treated as a save this build
  cannot read, and `Quest.Restore` rejects an undefined state with `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`
  rather than holding one. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1), [#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **`GameScreen` no longer drops the task that begins the game**, logging a failed start through
  `ILogger` before rethrowing. The session recovers from the save failures that are expected, so
  anything reaching the log is a defect — but one somebody can now
  see. ([#1](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/issues/1), [#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **`LocalSaveProgressService` now really persists**, writing to a file and creating the save
  folder on first write. `HasProgress()` was a hardcoded `return true`, reporting progress it had
  never stored. ([#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
- **Text assertions no longer depend on the machine's language.** A screen test compared a quest
  title against an English literal with no culture pinned, failing the whole suite on any machine
  not running in English. ([#2](https://github.com/olivegamestudio/TDD/pull/2))
